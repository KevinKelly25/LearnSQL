# LearnSQL

LearnSQL is an easy to use and easy to access Web Class Database that is specialized for learning SQL.
This site has two main sections, the learning section where there is a large amount of tutorials about SQL.
In these tutorials we bring students the SQL standard definitions. After the written tutorial there
is questions based on the tutorial the student just did. In these questions the students
will write there own SQL statements and submit these statments to a live database to see if their
answers are correct. These answers will provide real database responses so students are exposed
to the real situations they may see out in the working world.

The second section is going to be an area for students to be able to test and practice thier own SQL code
in a sandbox envirment of thier own database. Teachers will also be able to look at these databases to check thier activity
and help with thier progress.
