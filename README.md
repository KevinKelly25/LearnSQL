# LearnSQL

LearnSQL is a web-based database application which provides a user-friendly environment for institutions to allow their students to experiment with relational data. This platform relies on [ClassDB](https://github.com/DASSL/ClassDB) which is produced through the efforts of ([DASSL](https://dassl.github.io/https://dassl.github.io/), read _dazzle_) at Western Connecticut State University.

## Product Mission Statement

The main topics which comprise the focal point of the application are categorized by end-user role:
 - Teachers are:
    - Able to create and drop courses
    - Supplied with an interface to view student database objects including tables, views, indexes, triggers, functions and their code
    - Manage teams of students within a class who share a schema
    - Examine student connection history and DDL activity
    - Interact and manipulate their class databases in addition to a personally owned schema
 - Students can:
    - View their own database objects including tables, views, indexes, triggers, functions and their code
    - Experiment with SQL and PL/pgSQL in the Workshop section where access is granted only to their personal and team schemas
