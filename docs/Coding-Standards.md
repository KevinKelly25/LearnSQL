### Coding Standards
We try our best to use and enforce the Airbnb style guide so that all of our code is formatted the same. To better enforce this styling we have installed and use ESLint in combination with Airbnb's extension to it `eslint-config-airbnb`. 

The Airbnb style guide for JavaScript can be found here: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
