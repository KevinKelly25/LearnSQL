    <h1>Primary and Foriegn Keys</h1>
    <p>Each row in a table has its own unique key.
      Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as foreign keys).
      Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.
      </br>
      </br>
      Part of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table.
      Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique primary key (PK) for each table.
      When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated;
      this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs.
      Other, more natural keys may also be identified and defined as alternate keys (AK).
      Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK).
      Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table.
      Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world,
      a globally unique identifier, when there are broader system requirements.
      </br>
      </br>
      The primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables.
      When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table.
      When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table,
      this design pattern can represent either a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.
      Most relational database designs resolve many-to-many relationships by
      creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tablesâ€”the relationship becomes an entity;
      the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK.
      The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs;
      there's seldom efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.
